# Spam-Email-Detection

#### This repository contains machine learning models that are able to classify an email message as spam or not. The data used is taken from Kaggle, [Phising Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset/data), which consists of thousands of spam and non-spam messages. This data is used as training material for machine learning models.

## Features:
#### Data Preprocessing: Cleaning dan preparing the dataset for model training using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
#### Data Standarization: Balancing the dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
#### Model Building: Implementing machine learning and train all the data. The algorithms used in this machine learning is Naive Bayes
#### Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
#### Email Spam Detection: Classifying a message into spam categories

## Technologies Used:
#### Python
#### Pandas
#### Sklearn
#### Joblib
#### Matplotlib
